### Summary of Terraform Modernization

- **Project Goal**: Overhaul the existing Terraform setup for provisioning a Talos Kubernetes cluster on Proxmox, moving from a legacy configuration to a modern, declarative, and maintainable one.

- **Initial State**:
    - Deprecated `telmate/proxmox` provider.
    - Fragmented configuration using separate modules for control plane and worker nodes (`compute-master`, `compute-worker`).
    - Manual and error-prone process for node configuration and MAC address handling.

- **Key Changes and Improvements**:
    1.  **Provider Upgrade**: Replaced the `telmate/proxmox` provider with the current `bpg/proxmox` provider, enabling modern features and a more robust API interaction with Proxmox.
    2.  **Unified Module**: Consolidated the infrastructure definition into a single, cohesive module (`iac/terraform/talos-cluster`). This simplifies management and removes redundant code.
    3.  **Declarative Node Management**:
        - Implemented a central, declarative list of node objects in `variables.tf`. Each object defines a node's name, role, VMID, IP address, MAC address, hardware resources (cores, memory, disk sizes), and tags.
        - The entire cluster topology is now managed from this single variable, making it easy to scale or modify.
    4.  **Dynamic Configuration with `for_each`**:
        - Leveraged `for_each` to iterate over the nodes map (derived from the variables in `locals.tf`), creating VM and cloud-init resources dynamically. This makes the code DRY and scalable.
    5.  **Corrected Cloud-Init Handling**: Implemented `proxmox_virtual_environment_file` resources to correctly manage and upload Talos cloud-init configurations for each node, which is the standard practice for the `bpg/proxmox` provider.
    6.  **Static MAC Address Workflow**: The process now relies on pre-defined static MAC addresses in `variables.tf`, which must be mirrored in the `talconfig.yaml`. This eliminates the old, imperative workflow of running Terraform to discover dynamic MACs and then updating other configuration files.
    7.  **Resolved Technical Hurdles**:
        - **Authentication**: Corrected the Proxmox API token format.
        - **Storage**: Fixed errors on ZFS-based storage (`datapool`) by explicitly setting the disk `file_format` to `raw` for secondary disks.
        - **VM ID Management**: Enforced a strict and organized VM ID scheme (2xx for workers, 3xx for control plane) by explicitly setting the `vm_id` in the VM resource, preventing Proxmox from assigning arbitrary IDs.
        - **Conditional Disk Attachment**: Refined the logic to ensure that only worker nodes are provisioned with the large secondary disk for Longhorn storage.

- **Final Outcome**: The result is a robust, modern, and easy-to-manage IaC setup for the Talos cluster. The entire infrastructure is defined declaratively, significantly improving reproducibility and reducing the potential for human error.
